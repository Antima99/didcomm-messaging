### Internationalization (i18n)

Because automation makes life easier for humans, the data in DIDComm messages is usually assumed to have software as its audience. However, sometimes humans should see part of the data in a DIDComm message. For example, if the high-level application protocol running atop DIDComm is a kind of rich chat, humans may not see message headers and the details of threads -- but they will want to read the text sent to them by a friend. Similarly, humans may need to read error messages or terms and conditions in their natural language.

DIDComm offers some simple i18n tools to address this need. These tools are design to impose no up-front design burden on protocol implementers; i18n support can be added once a protocol has adoption, with very little effort.

#### Internationalized by default

The default assumption about every field in a DIDComm message is that it is locale-independent (internationalized) already. Since number representation is governed by JSON syntax, and dates are represented as seconds-since-epoch or as ISO/IETF 3339 strings, this assumption is automatically true for data types that are not strings.

All string values in DIDComm messages are encoded as UTF-8, which is capable of representing the full Unicode character inventory. However, the default assumption for every string field in DIDComm also MUST be that it is locale-independent. This is appropriate for headers like `id` and `type`, for fields that contain URIs, and so forth.

#### Declaring the locale of text fields in a message

When a message has one or more fields of localizable text, the locale of their values MAY be declared with the `lang` header. This header works much like `lang` in HTML, and its value comes from [IANA's language subtag registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry). If this header is present, then any string field inside `body` that contains human-readable text (according to the active protocol's definition of the message type) MUST hold text in the named language.

This header MAY be used by the recipient to call a machine-translation service that generates alternative text in other languages. It MAY also be used by the sender, in conjunction with a `l10n` (localization) header, to provide pre-translated alternatives. The `l10n` header is an array of triples (3-item arrays) where each triple is in the form ("lang", "field", "translation"). 

For example, suppose a chess protocol allows players to include human-friendly comments with their moves. When Alice puts Bob in checkmate, DIDComm i18n features might show up in a message for this protocol, like this:

```json
{
  "id": "388d599a-fdc1-4890-b32a-be6cd3893564",
  "type": "https://didcomm.org/chess/1.0/move",
  "lang": "en",
  "l10n": [
    ["fr", "comment", "C'est Ã©chec et mat, mon pote."]
    ["es", "comment", "Eso es jaque mate, amigo"]
  ],
  "body": {
    "move": "BC4+",
    "comment": "That's checkmate, buddy."
  }
}
```

#### Requesting translations

The `lang` and `l10n` headers are set by a sender. But how does the sender know what language a recipient wants? A recipient MAY declare their preference using the `accept-lang` header. The value of this header is an array of [IANA's language codes](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry), ranked from most to least preferred. Once a language preference has been set, it MUST be assumed to apply for the duration of an application-level protocol instance (a thread); parties who see this header MAY assume it also applies to future interactions as well. So in our chess example, Bob could save Alice the trouble of including Spanish translations by adding `"accept-lang": ["fr"]` to a message at the beginning of their chess game.
