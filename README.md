# DIDComm Messaging

DIDComm Messaging is a powerful way for people, institutions, and IoT things to interact, using features of [decentralized identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) (DIDs) as the basis of security and privacy. It works over any transport: HTTP, BlueTooth, SMTP, raw sockets, and sneakernet, for example.

This repo is where we develops specs and reference code to explain DIDComm Messaging. Some of the work incubated here is likely to be standardized at IETF or in other places, but its home is here.

### Process

The specs we're working on are broken into sections. Each section is a separate markdown document. Different sections are at different stages of maturity. Specs evolve through PRs and github issues on this repo. See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TS4XXCtlNL9YwW-Op9alevOmhgY2RP6lFfQ3AtB6Sq8/edit) for more details.

### People
Contributors to the repo come from [DIF's DIDComm Working Group](https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-starts-didcomm-working-group-9c114d9308dc). [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bZBkVrC8Fh5N16oBi2zAoqPxCTghUhpB/view) is our charter.

Our working group meets each Monday at 12 pm PST / 9 pm CET at https://zoom.us/j/199841436. A rolling agenda is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BpTm5SmgfOJcEsXfizO0ZmH1r7imTJDGKudAZtYsm0M/edit). You can also find us at https://dif.slack.com and on our mailing list at [didcomm-wg@dif.groups.io](mailto:didcomm-wg@dif.groups.io). Anybody is welcome to listen in; however, we need IPR protections around what we build, to keep it free from patent encumbrances -- so if you'd like to contribute more formally, please email [membership@identity.foundation](mailto:membership@identity.foundation).

### Relationship to General DIDComm

**DIDComm** is a general approach to communication that root their security and interaction behaviors in the properties of . **DIDComm Messaging** is a specific variant of DIDComm oriented around peer-to-peer message exchange. A slightly stale tutorial about DIDComm Messaging can be found [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0005-didcomm); we'll shortly have newer materials.
